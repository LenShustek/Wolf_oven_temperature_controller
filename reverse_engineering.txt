The initial phase of this project was reverse-engineering how the knob and the oven's 
control algorithm works. Here are some of the things we learned: 

The knob display is controlled by a single line of the 10-conductor cable that 
supplies both 6V power and data encoded as serial ASCII at 2400 baud. The line is 
mostly high, so stable power to run the knob can be derived with low-pass filtering 
and a large storage capacitor. 

Each of the four digits is a 7-segment display. Only the following subset of ASCII is 
shown: 0123456789 ABCDEFHIJLNOPTU abcdefhijnortuy, plus some other strange glyphs. 

Characters are sent as 8 bits of data starting with the least significant bit, then a 
parity bit and one stop bit. Three characters are sent representing the three display 
positions, followed by a checksum that makes the four bytes sum to zero. It takes 
about 17 milliseconds to send those four characters, and that sequence is repeated 
about every 100 milliseconds. If no characters are sent for about 2 seconds, the knob 
display blanks. 

The mode selection is encoded by the knob into 4 binary bits, of which 10 are valid 
codes. The detailed encoding is in the source code. 

Activating the up-down temperature toggle switch causes one of two lines to be 
momentarily grounded. 

When a heating mode like "BAKE" is first activated, the oven goes into a fast-heat 
mode by turning both heating elements on high. After the first time the heating 
element goes off, any time it goes on again it will be in a slower-heat mode. 

There can be a delay of as much as ten seconds between the time the oven sees a 
change in the oven temperature and when the heating element goes on or off.
